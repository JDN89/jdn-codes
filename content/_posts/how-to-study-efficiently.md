## Making it stick

Learning is supposed to be effortful and difficilt. If the way you learn is easy, it's like a footprint in the sand, visible now and gone in few seconds (find better anology).

learning is supposed to feel uncomfortbla in the beginning

I learned most of my mmasters byjust reading the text book, highlighting important parts and making a resume. 
two of the 3 methods I used are not efficient! rereading and highlighting.
we never learn how to learn efficiently

## Key learning concepts

Retrieval practice is a better way of learning then just rereading, trying ot activily retrieve some information from your memory, for example with flashcards.

Trying to solve a problem, before beign giving the solution is also a better way of learning - even if you make errors.

spacing out retrieval practice - the longer you wait the more difficlt it fields to retrieve information but the effort produces longer lasting memory.

Learn in as many ways as possible, audio visual, draw out diagrams,...

foundation of prior knowledge. You need a solid knowledge base before branching out in more specialised topics

Explain what you learn in your own words and connect it in a meaningfull way to what you learned before and you allready know

Ability to extract key ideas form learning material and putting it into a mental model and connecting it to prior knowledge 

## more in detail
In school we focus to much on rereading, highlighting and underlining. These are all easy, but more importantly, inefficient ways of learning!
Learning is supposed to be hard, especially if you want to ingrain the knowledge into your brain.

When we reread we get familiar with the text, giving us a false sense of understanding. We focus to much on learning phrases and definitions by heart, without really trying to grasp the underlying ideas and concepts and connect it to previously learned knowledge. Same goes with learning to a teacher, we focus to much on the way the teacher phrases things and copy his sentences word for word, without really trying to listen and understand what it is he's actually saying.

This is how I used to learn everything and this is how 80% of the students learn.

## Reflection
Reflect on what happened and what you learn. If something went wrong or not as expected, write it out. Figure out how you can improve upon it and adapt it for the future.
I myself keep a work journal in Notion, where I keep track of the major things I learned and encountered during the week. This way, I can keep track of my progress, analyze it and see what is going well or wrong.

This might be one of the most important points for improving in your job, actually taking the time to reflect upon what you're doing or planning to do. To many people go through their jobs without reflecting upon what it is they're doing.

Reflecting also means retrieving the information from memory, which in turn means that you'll retain the retrieved information even better
