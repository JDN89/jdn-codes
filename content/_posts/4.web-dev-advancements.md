## Discussing new web dav tech
For my Next project (study buddies) I want to build an JAMStack app made with nuxt 3.
I often come accross some web dev terms thaht are still a little vague to me.
I'm going to describe them in detail in order to understand them better and get a better grasp of the concepts I want to implement in my app

### Edge functions vs Serverless functions vs CDN caching?
do edge functions replace CDN caching?

### lazy loading vs code splitting (nuxt) vs tree shaking

### SPA, PWA, SSR, static,...

### Evoution of hosting: Vercel vs Netlify vs AWS vs Azure

### HMR - hot module replacement (vite vs webpack)

### Vite vs Webpack

### Supabase -api as a service

Going to use for my next project (NUXT 3 - studdy buddies)
