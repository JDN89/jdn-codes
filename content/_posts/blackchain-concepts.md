## The bitcoin standard

The larger your economy becomes the more specialisation their will be. If you only have a handful of people in a village, everybody will be producing the basic goods for survival.
If you have millions of people -> people can start to specialise and produce goods beyond the scope of basic survival.
How do you trade these goods - the issue of direct exchange:
- Your good may differ in value for the goods you want to trade it wiht
- Your good might perish quickly but the good you want to trade it for is durable -> how do you trade fruits for a hosue? the fruits will have rotten before you sealed the deal
- Goods might have different locations -> how do you trade a car with another car located in a different country?

Enter money: money is a good that facilitates trade and is a accepted as a medium of exchange.
- money doesn't get consumed
- money is not used for the production of other goods 
- very liquid -> easy to transact
- risk free
The cost of holding money:
- holding money means not have bought some consumption goods
- holding money means losing out on the possible returns of investments you could have made with said money.
