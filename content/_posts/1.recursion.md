## Slow recursion - dynamic programming to the rescue

#### The LeetCode problem - Climbing stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

#### Example
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

#### First attempt - recursion
```ts
public class Solution {
    public int ClimbStairs(int n) {
        //base case;
        if (n ==1 || n== 0 ) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            
        return ClimbStairs(n-1) + ClimbStairs(n-2);
        }
        
    }
}
```

#### Failure

I thought to solve this issue with recursion and I was passing the tests until n = 34.
For bigger values I received the error : Time Limit Exceeded. This
