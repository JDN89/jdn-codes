## Blog.init 

For years I've been using a personal journals to track my progress and write about your everyday live.

So when I had the idea of creating this portfolio page I took the opportunity to add a blog section.

**talk about deployment and technologies**

For the contents of the blog

I decided to create a blog where I'll write mostyl about coding related subjects.



This site is still a work in progress 
learning to code
sometimes easier to understand hard to graps topics by writing it out in your own words
I'll also write out future projects in this blog -> the making of -> struggles -> maybe some book reviews?
