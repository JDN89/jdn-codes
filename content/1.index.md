# Jan De Niels

Hey, I Am Jan De Niels, an economist with a masters in the Sience of Bussiness and a passion for programming.

Solving problems in creative ways and thinking of ideas and making them come through via coding is where my passion lies. 

You might be wondering, if I like coding so much, why don't I have a bachelor or masters closer related to IT? Good question! Through my jobs as a test analist and business analist I was working closely with developers. I realised that I always liked the developers jobs more then my own job. I told this to a friend who's a developer, and he told me: "Jan why don't you teach yourself how to code, all the information is online adn if  you have to motivation and the passion you can do it" - which I did.

I started with reading Head Fist Javascript at the end of 2019, and I haven't stopped coding since. 

Outside of Programming, I enjoy doing sports, reading books, playing chess, going for a drink or coffee and going to the movies.

## Skills

### Currently Learning

- **Rust**: I spend most of my time in the CLI with NeoVim and I would love to create some CLI apps and improve my coding skills along the way - enter Rust!
- **Nuxt 3**: a few weeks ago [Nuxt Content v2](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js/status/1529161019112800256) came out and I thought this was time to learn some Nuxt basics and use Nuxt content to write my portfolio and attach a blog to it!
