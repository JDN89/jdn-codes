## Jan De Niels


Hello, 
I am Jan, an economist with a passion for coding - welcome to my blog!

I love learning and solving problems, which is what drew me to programming and this is probably also the reason why I like playing chess so much.

Besides programming, I enjoy practicing sports (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, indoor Bouldering, Cycling,...), reading, going to concerts or movies, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and playing the occasional video game.  
I used to love travelling, but I've spend quiet some time backpacking through South-America and I got tired of travelling and living out of a backpack - adieu Adventuring days & welcome casa live!

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/JDN89) and contact me at __jan.de.niels@gmail.com__
