## Jan De Niels


Hello,  

I am Jan, an economist with a passion for coding - welcome to my blog/portfolio!

You might wonder, "how did someone with a background in economics get into coding?!" 
That's a good question!  
After working closely with programmers (as a test analyst and a business analyst), I decided to learn the basics of programming in order to understand better what some of my colleagues were doing. I enjoyed programming so much, that I decided to switch career paths and bacme a developer.

Besides programming, I enjoy practicing sports (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, indoor Bouldering, Cycling,...), reading, going to concerts or movies, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and playing the occasional video game.  

If you happen to read this portfolio and you like chess as well, feel free to add me on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home) my username is JDN89.

## Currently Learning

- **Nuxt 3**: A few weeks ago [Nuxt Content v2](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js/status/1529161019112800256) came out and this seemed the perfect framework for writing this portfolio!
