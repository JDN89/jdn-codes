## Jan De Niels

Hey, I Am Jan De Niels, an economist with a masters in the Sience of Bussiness and a passion for programming.

Thinking out projects, solving problems and making it all come to life through coding is where my passion lies.

You might be wondering, If coding is my passion, why didn't I get a masters or bacherlors degree in this field?
I worked close together with developers in my previous jobs and I soon realised that I prefered the work they were doing.
At the end of 2019 I read 'Head first javascript' and I haven't stopped coding since.

Besides coding I enjoy doing sports, reading, going to concerts, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and going to the movies.
