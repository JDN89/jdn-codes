## Jan De Niels


Hello, 
I am Jan, an economist with a passion for coding - welcome to my blog/ portfolio!

After working closely with programmers I decided to learn the basics of programming in order to understand better what my colleagues were doing. I enjoyed programming so much, that I decided to switch career paths and focus my attention on it full-time since the summer of 2021.

Besides programming, I enjoy practicing sports (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, indoor Bouldering, Cycling,...), reading, going to concerts or movies, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and playing the occasional video game.  

If you happen to read this portfolio and you like chess as well, feel free to add me on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home) my username is JDN89.



You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/JDN89) and contact me at __jan.de.niels@gmail.com__

- **Nuxt 3**: A few weeks ago [Nuxt Content v2](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js/status/1529161019112800256) came out and this seemed to me the perfect technology ofr writing this blog!
