## Jan De Niels

Hey, I am Jan De Niels, an economist with a passion for coding.

I like solving problems (probably also the reason why I like chess), learning, coming up with project ideas, coding them out and occasionally smash my head against the wall when I'm stuck on a bug for some hours (days?).
Solving problems, thinking out projects, and making it all come to life through coding is where my passion lies.

Besides coding I enjoy doing sports, reading, going to concerts, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and going to the movies.

### Currently Learning

- **Rust**: I spend most of my time in the CLI with NeoVim and I would love to create some CLI apps and improve my coding skills along the way - enter Rust!
- **Nuxt 3**: a few weeks ago [Nuxt Content v2](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js/status/1529161019112800256) came out and I this seemed to perfect opportunity to write a headless CMS blog!
