## Jan De Niels


Hello, 
I am Jan, an economist with a passion for coding - welcome to my blog!

I started programming in 2019 out of sheer curiousity. I enjoyed it so much that I switched my focus to it fulltime in the summer of 2021 and decided to swith career paths and become a software developer.

Besides programming, I enjoy practicing sports (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, indoor Bouldering, Cycling,...), reading, going to concerts or movies, playing chess, hanging out with my friends and playing the occasional video game.  

If you happen to read this portfolio and you like chess as well, feel free to add me on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home) my username is JDN89.



You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/JDN89) and contact me at __jan.de.niels@gmail.com__
