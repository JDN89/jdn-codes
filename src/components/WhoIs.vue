            <p>Hello, I'm <span text-gru-orange>Jan</span>! [wave]
                <br>
                Welcome to my <span text-gru-orange>terminal</span> inspired portfolio website!
                <br>
                I am a self taught software developer with a master degree in economics and a <span
                    text-gru-orange>passion for coding.</span>
                <br>
                you might be wondering, 'if you like coding so much, then why didn't you get a masters or bachelor in
                that
                field?'
                <br>
                Good question!
                The answer is quiet simple, I discovered that I liked Programming more then economics only after I
                graduated! (embarres imoji)
                <br>
                I wrote, my <span text-gru-orange>first lines</span> of code in 2019 (thank you freecodecamp.org).
                <br>I was stuck in <span text-gru-orange>tutorial hell</span> in 2020 (like most self taught developers
                I Imagine :p)
                <br>and I started coding my own <span text-gru-orange>projects</span> in the beginning of 2021 and
                that's what I've been doing since.
